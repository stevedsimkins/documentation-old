# ðŸ™Œ Submarine API

Submarining is the process of uploading content that remains private and off the public IPFS network. You can [read more about why Pinata developed this solution here](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/introducing-submarining-what-it-is-why-you-need-it). With Pinata Submarine, you can keep content private and generate access tokens programmatically that last for as long as you specify.&#x20;

This API can be used for uploading files and folders, listing content, and generating access tokens to view and download content.&#x20;

Viewing Submarined content requires a [Dedicated Gateway](https://knowledge.pinata.cloud/en/articles/5455525-how-to-set-up-a-dedicated-ipfs-gateway). When viewing Submarined content through a Dedicated Gateway, you must include a valid access token. The access token can be generated using [this API method](auth/generate-access-token.md). This is how you should construct a link to view Submarined content:&#x20;

**Single File**

`GATEWAY_URL/ipfs/FILE_CID?accessToken=TOKEN`



**File Within a Folder**

`GATEWAYURL/ipfs/FOLDER_CID/FILE_NAME?accessToken=TOKEN`
