# üîì Submarining

Submarining is a premium Pinata feature that allows users to share unlockable content with their community. Technical and non-technical creators can give fans access to exclusive gated content via NFT ownership, Retweets, and geo-location via API, or with our no-code solution at [Submarine.me](https://www.submarine.me/).

For developers, submarining provides the security to store files for apps and marketplaces, without the risk of their data being exposed. Similarly, creators who use NFTs to monetize their creative work can now share content with their customers without leaving their data on public IPFS, which reduces the risk of stolen content and NFT media.

**This can be done from the dashboard of your Pinata account, just upload your file, folder, or CID and choose to Submarine your content! ‚¨áÔ∏è**
